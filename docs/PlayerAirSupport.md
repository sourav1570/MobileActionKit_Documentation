## Introduction
This video will guide you on how to setup the air support for the player.

### Player Air Support Setup
Go to Tools < Mobile Action Kit < Player < Player < Create Air Support and assign the necessary gameObjects and components like shown in the video above. Your setup should look like this [See the image below].
