## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to setup Wave spawner and spawn AI agents within a spawn point and collider volume. We will make sure to spawn agents on the NavMesh Surface and will spawn certain number of AI agents in each wave.

            <td>Choose one of the three types of wave spawner activation.<br>
                1. 'StartWaveBasedOnSingleTrigger' (StartOnTriggerEnter): Spawner begins functioning once the player enters the collider trigger attached to this gameObject with no consecutive triggering required to spawn following waves.<br>
                2. 'StartWaveBasedOnMultipleTrigger' (EnterEachWaveTrigger): Initiates waves based on specific triggers assigned to each wave. For instance, wave 1 starts when the player enters the trigger collider for wave 1, wave 2 when player enters trigger for wave 2, and the same applies to all subsequent waves.<br>
                3. 'ActivateAtGameStart' (BeginOnPlay): Starts functioning at the beginning of the gameplay without the need for trigger colliders.
