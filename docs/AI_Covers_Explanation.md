## Introduction
This is the Part-5 of Humanoid AI Covers and in this part you will learn about fields in the paragraph called 'Ai Covers' located in the 'Core AI Behaviour'.

### AI Covers

Fields in this section will take effect if AI agent will be structured the way that allows him take covers during combat.i.e If Ai agent is not configured to be stationary and 'Use Covers' checkbox is checked.Ai Agent detects cover assemblies by the colliders of their child cover points.And then creates the list of all covers within specified range. And then does requests to cover assemblies of interest during the combat state.

    <tr>
        <td>Cover Finder</td>
        <td>Drag and drop the child gameObject of this Ai agent which has a script named 'FindCovers' from the hierarchy into this field.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Choose Closest Covers</td>
        <td>If enabled, the Ai agent will find the closest covers from his current position. If this checkbox is disabled, the Ai agent will take a random cover within the range specified in the field 'RangeToFindCoverPoint'.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Switching Covers Probability</td>
        <td>The slider value below indicates the probability of the Ai agent switching to new covers. If the value is 100, the Ai agent will switch between different covers around him. If the value is 0, the Ai agent will not switch to any new cover after taking his first cover and will stay in his first cover for the duration of combat. Depending on the probability, the Ai agent will decide whether to pick a new cover or stay at the currently picked one. If the taken cover becomes invalid, the Ai agent will switch to another valid cover.</td>

        <td>Range to Find Existing Cover Points</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Open Fire Behaviour</td>
        <td>Fields in this subsection are setting the AI agent's weapon firing behavior while he is moving towards or between covers. This subsection is reused in three different combat-related paragraphs: Ai Charging, Ai Covers, and Ai Firing Points. In each case, this subsection defines Open Fire Behavior in relation to the parent paragraph's subject. In the 'Ai Charging' paragraph, fields will define shooting behavior in relation to enemies. In the 'AI Covers' paragraph, those fields are used in relation to covers. In the 'Ai Firing Points' paragraph, in relation to Firing points. The value in this field is related to cover instead of enemy or the Fire Point.</td>
