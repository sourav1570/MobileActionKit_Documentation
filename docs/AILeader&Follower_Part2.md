## Introduction
This is the Part-2 of AI Leader and follower and in this part you will learn about how the AI use the halt point between destinations.

### Create Halt Point

To create a halt point for the AI Agent Leader you need to add a component to the destination point called as 'AI Leader Halt Point'. [See the Image Below]

Halt points are designed as an additional stop points between destination points and  placed at a certain locations(street corners, gates, entrances etc. ) This script sets the various parameters for the Leader at the halt point.
