## Introduction
This video guides you through the inital steps for getting started with the Player in Unity. We'll be adding the Player in the city using editor windows, integrating necessary components and game objects. Furthermore, we'll be talking about some important scripts like First person controller, Player Manager, Crouch, Procedural bobbing and other scripts. Will also fine-tune values in those scripts and will also make sure to test the player setup.

### Setup Player
Firstly,you have to go to the Tools < Mobile Action Kit < Player < Player < Create Player. This will automatically create the player for you and will reset it's position and rotation. You can just position it to the city and push play in unity to test it.

### Two Types of Player Running Option
You can choose either 'Run or Walk Switch' Or Hold Run. The difference between both is If you choose 'Hold Run' than you can hold the Run UI button to move the player in the forward direction with the set amount of speed specified in the First Person Controller script paragraph named as 'Speeds'. If you choose 'Run or Walk Switch' than you can switch between either Run or walk by clicking on the Run UI button this button by default have the 'Run Sprite' meaning if you click on it, The image will be changed to 'Walk Sprite' which allow the player to use the Joystick to navigate around the city with the run speed specified in the First Person Controller script paragraph named as 'Speeds'. If you click on the Run UI button again which now have the 'Walk Sprite' this will change the sprite to 'Run Sprite' and this will allow the player to use the joystick to navigate around the city with the walk speed specified in the First Person Controller script paragraph named as 'Speeds'.

The Player Manager script manages various player HUD Ui elements for interactions with game environment and Weapons.

### Multiple Ambient Sounds Player
This script, handles the playback of ambient sounds in the game. It supports playing sounds either randomly or sequentially, based on the 'PlaySoundsRandomly' field. Each sound can have unique properties such as volume, priority, loop behavior, and a time range for playback duration. The script uses a coroutine to manage the timing and playback of sounds, ensuring seamless transitions between them. It requires an 'AudioSource' component on the same GameObject to function properly and can be configured using the 'AmbientSoundProperties' list.
