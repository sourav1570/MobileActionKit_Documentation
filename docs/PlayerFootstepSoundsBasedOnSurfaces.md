## Introduction
This video will guide you on how to setup different footstep sounds at different surfaces i.e - Grass,Metal. There are two ways using which you can create footstep sounds at different surfaces. You can detect at which collider the player is moving by using Trigger based collider Or by using Raycast.

### Player Surfaces (Collider Detection)
You can create any collider example: A Box collider and check its is Trigger Checkbox and add a component to that gameObject called 'PlayerSurfaces'. [See The Image below]

Script Info: This Script is Responsible To Change the Player Walk and Run Sounds Within the Surface Area For Example : Metal Surface , Grass Surface etc...

### Player Surface Detector (Raycast Detection)
You can create an empty gameObject and make it to be the child of 'Player' and rotate it's X Axis at 90 degree and position it little bit above from the ground and add the component to it called 'PlayerSurfaceDetector' and using the script you can tweak different values and decide which audio clip to playback when the player walk/run/jump on a certain surface with a unique tag.[See The Image below]

Script Info: The PlayerSurfaceDetector script offers a sophisticated solution for enhancing player behavior through dynamic footstep sound adjustments based on terrain/Mesh types. By employing tags and raycasting, this approach continuously checks ahead of the Player at intervals set by Min/Max timers. It provides detailed environmental responsiveness, allowing player to interact realistically with various surfaces like grass, concrete, or wood. However, due to its continuous raycasting nature, developers should consider performance implications, particularly on mobile platforms where it may slightly impact FPS. For smaller environments, alternative script like 'PlayerSurfaces' which do collider-based detection may be more performance-efficient, ensuring optimal gameplay experience across different device capabilities.
