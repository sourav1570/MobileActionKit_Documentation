## Introduction
This video guides you through the steps required to implement Minimap for player. We'll be adding the minimap using Unity's editor windows, integrating necessary components and game objects.

### Setup Minimap
Firstly,you have to go to the Tools < Mobile Action Kit < Player < Player < Create Minimap. This will open up the MiniMap setup wizard where in the first field you have to drag and drop the Player from the hierarchy. In the second field you have to drag and drop the 'Required Scripts' gameObject from the hierarchy. In the third field you have to drag and drop the Canvas 2D from the hierarchy and in the last field you have to go to project and create a render texture and drag and drop it to the last field in the wizard called 'Render Texture' and than click the button 'Add Required UI'.

### MiniMap
The purpose of a minimap script is to provide player with a smaller, simplified version of the game world that helps them navigate and understand their surroundings.
