## Introduction
This video will guide you on how to achieve 'Strafing' behaviour on the humanoid AI agent during combat state.

### Agent Strafing
First enable 'Strafing' located in the combat state behaviour.[See the image below]

Enabling it will show Strafing options in the script which you can tweak to achieve the desired behaviour.

        <td>Force Custom Strafing</td>
        <td>If enabled, Ai agent will move between Predefined Custom strafe directions specified in the field 'Custom Strafe Directions'. This becomes very useful when you want the Ai agent to strafe only in one or two directions, for example: strafing right or left.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Randomize Between Stop Or Strafe Cycles</td>
        <td>If enabled, Ai agent will have a 50/50 chance of deciding whether to strafe and shoot or stop and shoot.</td>

        <td>Enables strafing AI agent to have periods of aiming without actual shooting between shooting cycles. Otherwise, AI agent will continuously shoot at its target until this target is destroyed or no more ammo is left in the magazine, in which case AI agent will reload his weapon and continue firing at its target.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Shooting Probability</td>
        <td>Adjust the slider value and decide what should be the shooting probability of this Ai agent. The bigger the number, the higher the chances of the Ai agent to consider shooting, and the smaller number will result in less chance of shooting.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Procedural Strafing</td>
        <td>This solution provides 360 strafing directions to AI agent. Actual distances of those directions will be also limited by 'Min/Max time Till Next Strafe Direction' timer same as custom strafe directions. Procedural strafing is more preferable for cases when AI agent is situated on small isolated Navmesh pieces as it will still allow AI agent to strafe within limited ranges like balcony, watch tower or a small roof or any enclosure of a small space.</td>
