## Introduction
This video will help you understand how to achieve patrol behaviour on humanoid AI agent in Non combat behaviour.Firstly, you need to make sure to have the same Team ID as the player
so we can test this behaviour on Humanoid AI agent.You can simply copy the Team ID from the target script attached with the player and paste it to the humanoid AI agent.[See the image]

### Choosing Patrol behaviour
To choose the patrol behaviour select the Core AI Behaviour script and than expand the Non combat behaviour and choose the 'Patrol' behaviour from the dropdown menu.This will enable the patrolling script below where you can tweak the values to achieve the desired behaviour.

### Create Patrol Point

To create patrol point first right click in the hierarchy and create a cube(this is only for visualisation purpose i.e you can later remove the 'Mesh Renderer' and 'Mesh Filter' when
you make a build) rename the cube to be 'Patrol Point' and change its tag to 'PatrolPoint'. Position it in the scene view where you want.
Note: To Find the patrol point and store it in a list. It's Important to have a collider attached to it. Any collider is acceptable(Box,Capsule,Sphere etc..)
