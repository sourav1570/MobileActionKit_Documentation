## Introduction
This video will help you understand how to achieve 'Charging' behaviour on the humanoid AI agent during combat state.

### AI Charging
First enable 'Ai Charging' located in the combat state behaviour.[See the image below]

Enabling it will show Strafing options in the script which you can tweak to achieve the desired behaviour.
