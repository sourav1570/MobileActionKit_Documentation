## Introduction
This is the Part-1 of Humanoid AI Firing Point Behaviour and in this part we have covered the topic called how to create a firing point and use it. You will also
going to learn how to use the Stop and shoot behaviour when moving to firing point.

### Create a Firing Point

To create the firing point you just need to create an empty gameObject and add a box collider to it.After that you need to change the layer of the gameObject to be 'IgnoreRaycast' and just add the script called 'Firing Point' to it.

<style>
    .custom-table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
        width: 100%;
    }
    .custom-table th, .custom-table td {
        border: 1px solid grey;
        padding: 8px;
        text-align: left;
    }
</style>

<table class="custom-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Fields</th>
        <th>Info</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Debug Firing Point Status</td>
        <td>If checked than Ai agent will debug firing point status if it is occupied or vacant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Debug Info Text UI</td>
        <td>This field is responsible for debugging firing point state in a form of text whether it is vacant or occupied.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Debug Info Text UI Offset</td>
        <td>Adjust text UI horizontally or vertically by tweaking values in this field.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Enable Crouch Firing</td>
        <td>If checked than Ai agent will crouch and shoot on this firing point position.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Specific Team Firing Point</td>
        <td>If checked than this firing point can only be available to one Team.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Team Name</td>
        <td>If the above field name 'SpecificTeamCover' is checked than it is required to enter the TeamName for which this firing point can be available too.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Use The Firing Point

To use the created firing point you need to enable the checkbox called 'Use Firing Points' in 'Combat state behaviours' of the Core AI behaviour script. This will allow the humanoid AI agent to use the Firing point in the game.

### Understand The Firing Point

When you enable the 'Use Firing Points' in 'Combat state behaviours' this will show you a paragraph below called 'Ai Firing Points'. 
more info about each field can be found below.

    <tr>
        <td>Firing Point Detection Behaviour</td>
        <td>Fields in this subsection will allow tweaking for AI agent to move towards the firing point.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Sprinting Behaviour</td>
        <td>Fields in this subsection will allow Ai agent to sprint towards the firing point in case structured that way.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Open Fire Behaviour</td>
        <td>Fields in this subsection are setting Ai agent's weapon firing behaviour while he is moving towards or between covers. This subsection is reused in 3 different combat related paragraphs. Those are - Ai Charging, Ai Covers and Ai firing points. And in each of those cases this subsection is defining Open Fire Behaviour in relation to parent paragraphs subject. In 'Ai Charging' paragraph fields will define shooting behaviour in relation to enemies. In case of 'AI Covers' paragraph those fields are used in relation to covers. And in 'Ai Firing Points' paragraph in relation to Firing points.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Switching Firing Points Probability</td>
        <td>The slider value below indicate what would be the probability of the Ai agent to switch new firing point. In case the value in the slider is 100 than the Ai agent will switch between different firing point around him. In case this value is 0 than the Ai agent will not switch between any new firing point after taking his first firing point and will make sure to stay in his first firing point only for the duration of combat. Depending on the probability Ai agent will decide whether to pick a new firing point or stay at the currently picked one.</td>
