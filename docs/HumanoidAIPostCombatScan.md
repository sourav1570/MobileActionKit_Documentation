## Introduction
This video will help you understand about the 'Post Combat Scanning' behaviour of the Humanoid AI agent.

### Enable Post Combat Scan
To enable the post combat scan behaviour select the Core AI Behaviour script and than expand the combat behaviour and check the checkbox 'Enable Post Combat Scan'.Checking this checkbox will display a sub section below called as 'Post Combat Aimed Scan Behaviour' where you can tweak the values to achieve the desired behaviour.
