## Introduction
This is the Part-1 of AI Leader and follower and in this part you will learn about how the AI agent moves between destination points with his followers.

### Enable AI As Leader

First make sure to enable the AI agent as leader by selecting the AI agent and than expand the 'Core AI Behaviour' script and change the Agent Role to be 'Leader'. This will
enable/add the script to the AI agent root object called 'AI Guide' using this script we can control the AI agent behaviour as 'Leader'.

        <td>Ai Leader will go through destination points in the order they are listed below. Starting from the point in 'Element 0' field. If Ai Leader encounters any resistance on his way, he will switch to other behaviors depending on the state those situations might put him into. As soon as all interrupting factors are eliminated and Ai Leader is no longer distracted, he will resume his destination-following behavior. After reaching the last destination point, Leader will switch to its default behavior (wandering, patrolling, etc.).</td>

### Enable AI As Follower

First make sure to enable the AI agent as follower by selecting the AI agent and than expand the 'Core AI Behaviour' script and change the Agent Role to be 'Follower'. This will
enable/add the script to the AI agent root object called 'AI Follower' using this script we can control the AI agent behaviour as 'Follower'.

### AI Follower

If you want this Ai agent to become the follower of another friendly Ai agent or the Player than this script is required to be attached with the field name 'Follower Agents' located in the script called 'AiGuide' Or the 'PlayerGuide' script.

        <td>Min Walking Distance to Leader</td>
        <td>Minimum distance before starting to walk towards the commander.</td>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Min Sprinting Distance to Leader</td>
        <td>Minimum distance to trigger sprinting towards the commander if the distance becomes greater.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Max Sprinting Distance to Leader</td>
        <td>Maximum distance to trigger sprinting towards the commander if the distance becomes greater.</td>
    </tr>

### Player Follower

This script allows the player to become a follower of the friendly AI agent. Simply drag and drop the player follower script onto the AI guide component. This will ensure that the AI waits for the player when moving towards destinations.

    <tr>
        <td>Min Near Distance To Leader</td>
        <td>Specify the minimum distance to the leader to continue moving towards the destination.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Max Near Distance To Leader</td>
        <td>Specify the maximum distance to the leader to continue moving towards the destination.</td>
    </tr>

### Create Destination Points

To create the destination points for AI agent leader you need to create 3D Cube in the hierarchy and place it wherever you want the AI agent leader to move to.
Make sure that this gameObject is close to the navmesh as much as possible. After setting it up you can remove/disable the 'Mesh Renderer' component and drag and drop this gameObject to the AI Guide script field name 'Destination Points'.
