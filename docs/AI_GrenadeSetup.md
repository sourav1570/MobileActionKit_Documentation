## Introduction
This is the Part-1 AI Grenades and in this part you will learn how to setup grenade for the 'Humanoid AI Agent' to throw at enemies.

### AI Grenade Setup

To be able to setup the grenade you need to follow the above tutorial which will guide you step by step on how to setup the grenade.

#### Explosive Collision

This script adds rigidbody to explosive just before it is about to collide any static or dynamic object along it`s trajectory.After adding rigidbody it applies the momentum force in the forward direction of the explosive specified in the field called 'Force Momentum'.For convenience reasons this script has fields that allow to set the properties of the rigidbody prior to its creation.

#### Explosive Notificator

This script is responsible for explosion behaviour of the grenade and also thus notify other humanoid Ai agent's about incoming grenade.This script is responsible to notify other humanoid Ai agent to sprint away from the incoming grenade based upon the configuration of the humanoid Ai agent.

#### Explosive Damage

This script is responsible for explosion behaviour of the grenade and also thus notify other humanoid Ai agent's about incoming grenade.This script is responsible for grenade damage behaviour to other entites in game like - Player or Ai.
