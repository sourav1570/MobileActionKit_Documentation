## Introduction
This video will help you understand Humanoid AI agent tactial interactions.How the AI agent detection enemies,Rotate spine bone,do enemy visibility checks,switch teams and much
more.This video highlights five scripts - FindEnemies Script,Humanoid Visibility Checker,Spine Rotation,Targets and Switch Team.

### FindEnemies Script
This component is necessary for the core Ai behaviour script in order to achieve target selection functionality. This script stores all detected enemies and selects nearest enemy by comparing distances from enemy detector gameobject to all detected enemies. There are two ways of detecting enemies.

1.Using detection radius i.e automatically detecting all Ai agents and discriminating enemies from friendlies.This method is used as a simpliest detection solution and can be used in situations where more complex solutions are not required. 

2.Using field of view within detection radius size to imitate human vision. This is more computationally complex solution and used in cases where first solution would not suffice developers due to its primitive nature that is more suitable for arcade gameplay but insufficient for tactical behaviour.Combining these detection methods to optimise mobile performance will have noticeable affect. In case of PC target platform difference in perfomance will have less noticeable.

### Targets
This script is used for the Ai agent to be able to identify other game AI agents and the player as friendlies or hostiles.

### Humanoid Visibility Checker
This script lets Ai agent to focus on the enemies using the Field of view while making sure to avoid any other obstacles in front using the raycasting.

### Spine Rotation
This Script Is Responsible For Rotating Ai Spine Bone.

    <tr>
        <td>Rotational Pivot Bone</td>
        <td>Drag and drop the spine bone that is located right below the  'BoneToRotate' in the skeleton of Ai agent.This bone will serve as a pivotal point for the rotating bone above it. In other words it will serve as a reference bone relative to which the rotations will be performed by the Shooting Point.It will be parametrically   rotating BoneToRotate  around RotationalPivotBone which serves as a reference gameObject to correctly offset the rotational angle values of 'BoneToRotate'.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Scan Aim Adjustment Points</td>
        <td>Specify vertical and lateral offset of the scan aiming pose for the 3 cases when Ai agent is performing scan aiming during walking, running and standing still to fine-tune the spine bending angle for each of those 3 cases. This improves overall appearance of scan aiming as it helps to fit together the best way the two separate upper body(for the torso) and lower body(for the legs) animations used together for those scanning aims.This random aiming is a part of area scanning functionality of the various non - combat states such as sound and dead body  investigating, following the leader and stationary area scanning while standing.The best overall looking of scan aiming poses is achieved by dragging and dropping those scan aiming points gameobjects into their respective fields and adjusting their position until the aiming pose looks the best it can.
        RunScanAimLevel and WalkScanAimLevel are used when Ai agent is on the move.StationaryScanAimLevel is for the cases when Ai agent stands still.</td>
