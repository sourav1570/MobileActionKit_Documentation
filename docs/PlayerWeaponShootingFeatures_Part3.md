## Introduction
This video will help you understand about player weapon script attached to the shooting point of the weapon.

### Player Weapon Script  
Player Weapon Script is the main script responsible for all kinds of weapons available to player, such as various kinds of firearms, grenades & melee weapons. It defines majority of aspects of weapons overall functionality & communicates with number of auxiliary scripts that are handling additional elements of the player weapons functionality. 

You will find below some of the fields and their tooltips for the Player Weapon Script.
