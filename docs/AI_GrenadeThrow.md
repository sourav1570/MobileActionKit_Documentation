## Introduction
This is the Part-2 of AI Grenades and in this part you will learn about fields inside the 'Humanoid Grenade Thrower' script.

### Use Grenades

To make Humanoid AI agent to be able to throw grenades at his enemies. You need to enable use grenades checkbox by going to 'Core AI Behaviour' script and than under 
'Combat state behaviours' check the checkbox 'Use Grenades'.

#### Humanoid Grenade Thrower

This script lets humanAI agent to throw grenades at enemies.

        <td>Lets you choose which of the two available grenade spawning methods will be used. First option is 'Spawn using object pooler' for optimizing processor performance by allocating a couple of megabytes of RAM for storage of a predefined amount of grenades to be pooled from the memory. Second option is 'Spawn Using Instantiation' which does not require extra RAM allocation and relies entirely on the CPU and contributes to garbage collection process. Choose one of the two options depending on the target device or platform. Usually first option is more preferable for mobile devices. In the case of consoles or desktop, it will not make any noticeable difference. If spawn using object pooler option is selected, then the user has to specify the overall amount of grenades inside the object pooler script.</td>
