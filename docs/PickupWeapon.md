### Pickup Weapon And Attachment Script
After clicking on 'Create Pickup Weapon' button in the wizard. This will going to add the Box Collider and the Pickup Weapon script to the weapon and Attachment Key script to the attachments.
 
#### Pickup Weapon
This script allows weapons placed in the scene to be picked up by the player. When the player enters the pickup area, the script checks if the weapon already exists in their inventory. If a matching weapon is found, it can either replace the existing weapon or can just pickup its ammo. The script also provides initial ammo, and optionally activates a random attachment when the game begin. Additionally, it supports displaying a UI confirmation for weapon pickups. The weapon becomes inactive after being picked up to prevent duplicate pickups.
