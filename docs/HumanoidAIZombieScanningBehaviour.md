## Introduction
This video will help you understand how to achieve scanning behaviour on humanoid AI agent in Non combat behaviour.Firstly, you need to make sure to have the same Team ID as the player
so we can test this behaviour on Humanoid AI agent.You can simply copy the Team ID from the target script attached with the player and paste it to the humanoid AI agent.[See the image]

### Choosing Scan behaviour
To choose the scan behaviour select the Core AI Behaviour script and than expand the Non combat behaviour and choose the 'Scan' behaviour from the dropdown menu.This will enable the scanning
script below where you can tweak the values to achieve the desired behaviour.
